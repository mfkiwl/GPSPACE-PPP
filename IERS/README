The source files in this directory were downloaded from the IERS conventions
center:
        iers-conventions.obspm.fr/conventions_versions.php  (v1.3.0)

IERS_v1_1_0 and IERS_v1_3_0 contain the original files and are linked to this
(IERS) directory unchanged, with the exception of:
 OLOADN.F          which is a modification of the Chap7/HARDISP.F program,
                   converting it to a subroutine usable in GPSPACE
 GPT2.F            where the file open/close is managed externally.
 DEHANTTIDEINEL.F  changed to properly call iau_DAT and iau_CAL2JD
 IERS_CMP_2015.F   conserved from earlier version (v1.1.0) of the mean pole computation
		   by default GPSPACE uses the new secular pole definition

Subroutine DEHANTTIDEINEL is called from bodyt.f to comZZpute earth tides.
Subroutine OLOADN is called from gpsppp.f to compute ocean tide loading.
Subroutine IERS_CMP_2015 is called from rderp.f to compute mean pole and
associated pole tide (if rderp si modified accordingly).

For tropospheric mapping and delay initialization,
- subroutine GMF is called from gpsppp.f
- subrouting GPT is called from rdmet.f
- subroutine GPT2 is called from rdmet.f
- subroutines VMF1 and VMF1_INT are called from vmfintrp.f
